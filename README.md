# SoundSpy üé∂üïµÔ∏è

**Short Summary:**  
A social music editing and spy game built fully on Polkadot Asset Hub using custom smart contracts!

---

## Full Description

**Problem it solves:**  
Music creation and collaboration are often limited to professional tools and lack playful, social interaction.  
SoundSpy brings social creativity by letting multiple players cooperatively edit a music piece ‚Äî while one secretly tries to sabotage it!  
The challenge: Can you identify the spy before your song gets ruined?

**How Polkadot Asset Hub helped:**

- We use Polkadot's smart contract functionality to manage contests, track players, and store contest lifecycle securely and trustlessly.
- Thanks to Polkadot Asset Hub, players can participate without centralized servers, and the final music edits can be minted as NFTs.

---

## Technical Description

**Smart Contract:**

- Built using Solidity for EVM compatibility on Polkadot Asset Hub (through EVM-pallet).
- Custom contract logic manages:
  - Contest creation
  - Player joins
  - Spy assignment
  - Round voting and scoring
  - Final winner selection

**SDKs and Libraries Used:**

- `ethers.js` for smart contract interaction
- `React` + `TypeScript` frontend
- `Vite` build system
- `TailwindCSS` for UI
- `useEffect`, `useContext` React hooks for web3 and audio state
- `OfflineAudioContext` API for browser-based music editing
- `React Router` for clean page navigation

**Why Polkadot made this uniquely possible:**

- Polkadot Asset Hub‚Äôs EVM support allows running custom Solidity contracts seamlessly.
- Low transaction fees made it realistic to update game states frequently (e.g., player votes, round updates).
- Polkadot's decentralized finality provides an honest, tamper-proof game outcome.
